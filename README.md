# devnotes
This repository contains public notes and ideas from Sunscreen developers. It serves as a place to quickly share ideas publicly without dealing with red tape like "peer-review" for publications or "a basic grasp of the English language" for blog posts.

While we try not to put utter slop in here, some of these may have been created during an octuple espresso shower thought bender. As such, they may not be sound or even worse, they could have typos or grammatical mistakes. You have been warned.
